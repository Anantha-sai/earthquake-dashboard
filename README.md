# 🌍 Earthquake Dashboard - Power BI

This project visualizes and analyzes global earthquake data using Power BI. It explores patterns in seismic activity, alert levels, and geographical distribution of major earthquakes.

Here's a dashboard I created to analyze global earthquake trends from 1995 to 2023, including:  
🌐 Top affected countries  
🔔 Tsunami and alert categories 
📅 Year-wise and month-wise trends  
📍 Global distribution with map visualization

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- Alert classification (Green, Yellow, Orange and Red)
- Magnitude trends by region and time
- Top countries by earthquake frequency
- Time series breakdown (Year/Month/Day)
- Severity vs. location mapping
- Insights from M6.0+ earthquakes

## 🗂️ Files

- [🔗 Power BI File (.pbix)](./Earthquake_Dashboard.pbix)
- [📊 Dataset (.xlsx)](./earthquake_data.xlsx)
- [🖼️ Dashboard Screenshot](./Earthquake_screenshot.png)

## 📌 Key Insights

- Over 55% of earthquakes triggered Yellow Alerts, signaling moderate risk.
- Most frequent high-magnitude events occur in Indonesia, Chile, Papua New Guinea, and Japan.
- M7.0+ earthquakes mostly happen within the Pacific Ring of Fire.

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Predictive modeling for future events
- Integration with real-time seismic feeds (USGS)
- Region-specific risk dashboards
